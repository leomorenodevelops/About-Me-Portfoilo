            <p>Hi, my name is Leo Moreno and I am an aspiring developer and currently a student in the U of U coding bootcamp. I live happily with my wife and two dogs, a 2 year old Bull Terrier and a 9 month old German Shepard. We love to go on family adventures like going for walks, or doing a lake day, going camping and even visiting friends and family. I love sports especially soccer, playing video games and going to reggae shows with my wife.</p>
            <p>Im currently in the aerospace industry as a Quality Inspector III. I am in the CH-53K program which is the helicoptors that are used by the marines to transport their cargo. These helicoptors are so massive that they can even transport a one ton tank! I inspect the quality of the carbon fiber frames that make up the whole entire body of the helicoptor after they have been painted. I enjoy what I do but I decided that it's time to change career paths and since I have always been interested in developing I decided that I want to pursue this career path.</p>
