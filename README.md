# About-Me-Portfoilo

## Description
I created this website as a starting point to showcase my portfolio. This project allowed me to describe a little bit about myself and display my completed projects in real time.

I learned a lot during this project about html and styling elements to make my website look professional. I also learned about making the website functional in allowing the user to click links which redirect them to another website such as my Linkdin, GitHub, etc.

## Installation
1. Write/review HTML and CSS code then preview and test all links
2. Push code to repo stored in Github 
3. Check to make sure website went live on Github
4. Make sure UI reflects deployed code
5. Clink links to verify they redirect to the correct URL
